Hi there! üëã
My name is Renato and I'm a passionate M.Sc. Student in Operations Research at the prestigious Georgia Institute of Technology. I'm captivated by the power of mathematical modeling and algorithmic optimization to solve complex real-world problems. Welcome to my GitHub repository, where curiosity meets academia and innovation!

üìö Academic Background
I'm currently expanding my knowledge and expertise at Georgia Tech, pursuing a Master's Degree in Operations Research. My coursework and research delve into various areas of the discipline, including but not limited to linear programming, network design, integer programming, stochastic models, and dynamic programming. I am particularly interested in the intersection of these topics with machine learning and data science.

üíª In This GitHub Repository
In this space, I share my academic work and personal projects, focusing primarily on Operations Research models and algorithms. I believe that knowledge should be shared openly, and I'm committed to making my work accessible to anyone interested in this fascinating field.

I strive to present my projects in a comprehensive and understandable way. Each model or algorithm has a dedicated README that includes a detailed explanation, potential applications, and, where applicable, references to academic papers or other resources. I hope that these resources can help others in their learning journey or research.

üéØ My Objectives
While this GitHub repository serves as a platform for me to share my academic endeavors and explorations, my larger goal is to contribute to the collective knowledge in Operations Research. I hope that my work here sparks curiosity and fosters a culture of continuous learning and collaboration.

ü§ù Let's Connect
Whether you're a fellow student, researcher, or simply someone interested in Operations Research, I'd love to connect! Please feel free to reach out to me through GitHub or LinkedIn. Feedback, collaboration proposals, or academic discussions are always welcome!

Thank you for stopping by my repository. Enjoy exploring!
